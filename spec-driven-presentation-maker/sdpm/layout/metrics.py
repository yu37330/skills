"""Objective quality metrics for a routed architecture layout.

Given the collected ``nodes``/``groups``/``edges`` produced by the layout
pipeline (see :func:`sdpm.layout.render.build_layout`), measure geometric
quality:

  - crossings     : pairs of edge segments that intersect
  - pierces       : edge segments passing through a non-endpoint node icon
  - group_pierces : edge segments passing through an unrelated framed group box
  - diagonals     : segments that are neither horizontal nor vertical
  - bad_ports     : first/last segment not perpendicular to its node edge
  - backwards     : first segment travels opposite to the port's outward normal

``measure_layout`` operates on already-collected geometry; ``measure`` is the
convenience wrapper that runs the pipeline first (used by the QA CLI). Both
return the same dict shape, including a lexicographic ``score``.
