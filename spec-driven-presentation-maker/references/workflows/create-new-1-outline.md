# Phase 1: Outline Design

Break the agreed brief into per-slide units.

## Deliverable

`specs/outline.md` — approved by the user.

You MUST NOT read the next workflow file until the user explicitly approves `specs/outline.md`.

## Constraints

- You MUST NOT read any other workflow file until `specs/outline.md` is approved
- You MUST read `guides storytelling-vocabulary` before starting the outline — it contains the presentation structure frameworks you need for Step 1
- Each slide MUST have exactly one message — if a message cannot be expressed in one sentence, split the slide
- Before each step, briefly explain what you are doing and what the user needs to decide
- Speak in the user's language, using plain words
- Use inference-based proposals: recommend with rationale, list alternatives briefly — let the user confirm or redirect
- The brief defines what to convey and why — story structure is decided here, not in the brief
- Also cover what the audience would naturally wonder, even if not in the brief
- Include or omit opening/closing slides (title, agenda, summary, ending) based on duration and audience — no need to ask separately

## Steps

### 1. Recommend a structure

Choose a presentation structure from storytelling-vocabulary that fits the brief's intent and audience.
Explain:
- **Why** this structure fits (brief content, audience attributes)
- **How** the slides will flow (concrete section sequence)
- **Effect** on the audience (what they'll take away)

Also mention 2-3 alternatives briefly so the user knows other options exist.

The user confirms ("ok") or redirects.

Example:

> The audience isn't familiar with this yet, so starting with the big picture before diving into each feature should work well.
> Flow: Big picture → Management features → Integration features → Next steps
> This way they can find the area most relevant to them.
> Other options: chronological order or highlights-only, but with this much content, grouping by topic keeps things organized.
>
> Sound good?

### 2. Write outline

Once the structure is confirmed, derive the full slide list from the brief and write `specs/outline.md`.

**Each line = 1 slide = 1 message** — what it changes in the audience and how.
`[slug]` — slug is a short kebab-case identifier that becomes the slide filename (`slides/{slug}.json`).

When multiple slides share the same visual base, give them the same slug prefix.
The stable base lets the audience focus on what changed, not re-read the whole slide.
Typical cases:
- Building up a diagram layer by layer — a complex picture shown all at once overwhelms; adding one piece at a time guides the eye
- Showing the whole first, then zooming into each part — the overview gives context, then each slide highlights one area with detail; the audience always knows where the detail fits
- Highlighting the current section in an agenda — when there are many sections, repeating the agenda with the active one marked keeps the audience oriented
- Swapping content in the same frame — identical layout makes differences stand out (case studies, comparisons, options)

```markdown
- [title] What it changes in the audience and how
- [current-state] What it changes in the audience and how
- [feature-a] What it changes in the audience and how
```

Present the outline to the user and ask for feedback.

Example:

> Here's the slide list based on the brief:
>
> - [title] Audience knows the topic and speaker
> - [big-picture] Audience sees how much has changed — sets expectation for depth
> - [arch-components] Audience grasps the building blocks
> - [arch-data-flow] Audience understands how data moves between components
> - [arch-security] Audience sees where guardrails are applied
> - [next-steps] Audience has a concrete action to take Monday morning
>
> Want to add, remove, reorder, or reword anything?

Iterate until the user approves.

Iterate until the user approves the outline.

## Next Step

Once the user approves the outline, offer three options.
Detailing means working out what to say, evidence, and supporting data per slide — this makes art direction decisions sharper, but takes more time.

Present the options so the user can answer with a single letter:

> Detailing talking points and evidence per slide helps art direction — knowing what to say clarifies what to show.
> **(a)** Detail all slides **(b)** Detail specific slides (e.g. "b 3,5,8") **(c)** Skip → art direction

- All → read `planner-answers` and follow its process for all slides. Do NOT enrich the outline yourself.
- Pick → read `planner-answers` and follow its process for the specified slides only.
- Skip → read `create-new-1-art-direction` and proceed to art direction.

Do not proceed without the user's explicit choice.
